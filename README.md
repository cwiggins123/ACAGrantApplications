# ACAGrantApplications
Example web application I made as a school project for the Acadiana Center for the Arts. This application, if finished, will allow panel members to score grant applications for art grants. 
Java REST service made with spring boot, located in the folder "INFX 490". Angular Web application in the folder "ACAGrants", if I can get this retarded website to allow me to upload the damn folder.
